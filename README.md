# No Horny Jail

A program that simply let's you change an osu! beatmap's background, in case of, but not limited to, Sotarks or Haitai.


## Planned Features

- Changing all of your maps backgrounds in [1]the blink of an eye 
- Option to choose either a color, or a custom image
- Keeps your dignity alive in the eyes of your family
- Won't loose NNN if you play despacito

PS: Other features can be rolled out in the future.

1: Depends on how much files you have and how much you target, if you have 10's of gigabytes, 
it may take some time. I will do my best to optimize the algorithms to be as efficient as my skill allows.
